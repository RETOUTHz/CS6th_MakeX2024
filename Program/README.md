## MATERIAL

### NOVAPI
    NovaPi is the new generation of main control board used in the MakeX Robotics Competition, featuring a high-performance M7 processor ATSAMS70N20A-AN and an STM32F030CCT6 coprocessor. There are five sensor interfaces, and six intelligent motor interfaces. The sensor interface uses serial communication, with 5V output. The motor interface also uses serial communication, with 12V output. NovaPi comes with a 6-axis sensor to measure both the acceleration and angular velocity of ratation in x, y, and z axes. NovaPi can also work with a power extension board to achieve more functions.

### ENCODER
    An encoder is a crucial component in many mechanical and electronic systems, providing precise feedback on the position, speed, and direction of a rotating or moving part.

### BRUSHLESS DC MOTOR
    Brushless DC Motors (BLDC) are a type of electric motor that differs from traditional brushed DC motors by using electronic commutation instead of mechanical brushes and a commutator.

### DC MOTOR
    A DC motor is a type of electric motor that runs on direct current (DC) electricity. It's widely used in various applications due to its simplicity and effectiveness.

### SMART SERVO
    A Smart Servo is a device used for precise mechanical motion control. Unlike regular servos, which consist of a motor, gears, and a position control system, smart servos have additional capabilities in control and communication, making them suitable for more complex applications.

### ALUMMINIUM
    Aluminium is a silver-white, soft metal, noted for lightness, high reflectivity, high thermal conductivity, high electrical conductivity, nontoxicity, and corrosion resistance. 

### CORRUGATES PLASTIC
    Corrugated Plastic is a versatile and durable material made from polypropylene or polyethylene plastic. It features a layered structure with parallel ridges and grooves, providing strength and rigidity while remaining lightweight.

### 3D PRINTER
    A 3D printer is a device that creates three-dimensional objects from digital models by laying down successive layers of material. This technology, known as additive manufacturing, has revolutionized various industries by enabling rapid prototyping, customization, and the creation of complex geometries.
